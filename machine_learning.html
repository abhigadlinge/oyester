        One of our great scientists, Stephen Hawking, said that “The development
        of full Artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race”.
        Artificial Intelligence is a very hot topic actually nowadays. We always
        wonder what else it can do, how it is a very interesting, strange, and
        special topic for our generation. Machine Learning is one of the topics
        in AI, which gives us the same feeling. Today in this article, we will
        explore about the Machine Learning in a simple way. How it can learn
        anything, examples, and their applications
      </p>

      <h3>What Is Machine Learning?</h3>

      <p>
        Machine learning is nothing new. The history, in fact, dates back over
        sixty years to when Alan Turing created the ‘Turing test’ to determine
        whether a computer had real intelligence. It can be argued, however,
        that the past 25-30 years have seen the biggest leaps and bounds in
        terms of advances in speech technology. But I’m getting ahead of myself
        here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of machine learning like this. As a human, and as a user of
        technology, you complete certain tasks that require you to make an
        important decision or classify something. For instance, when you read
        your inbox in the morning, you decide to mark that ‘Win a Free Cruise if
        You Click Here’ email as spam. How would a computer know to do the same
        thing? Machine learning is comprised of algorithms that teach computers
        to perform tasks that human beings do naturally on a daily basis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first attempts at artificial intelligence involved teaching a
        computer by writing a rule. If we wanted to teach a computer to make
        recommendations based on the weather, then we might write a rule that
        said: IF the weather is cloudy AND the chance of rainfall is greater
        than 50%, THEN suggest taking an umbrella. The problem with this
        approach used in traditional expert systems, however, is that we don’t
        know how much confidence to place on the rule. Is it right 50% of the
        time? More? Less?
      </p>

      <p>
        For this reason, machine learning has evolved to mimic the
        pattern-matching that human brains perform. Today, algorithms teach
        computers to recognize features of an object. In these models, for
        example, a computer is shown an apple and told that it is an apple. The
        computer then uses that information to classify the various
        characteristics of an apple, building upon new information each time. At
        first, a computer might classify an apple as round, and build a model
        that states that if something is round, it’s an apple. Then later, when
        an orange is introduced, the computer learns that if something is round
        AND red, it’s an apple. Then a tomato is introduced, and so on and so
        forth. The computer must continually modify its model based on new
        information and assign a predictive value to each model, indicating the
        degree of confidence that an object is one thing over another. For
        example, yellow is a more predictive value for a banana than red is for
        an apple.
      </p>

      <h3>So Why Is Everyone Talking About Machine Learning?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          These basic algorithms for teaching a machine to complete tasks and
          classify like a human date back several decades. The difference
          between now and when the models were first invented is that the more
          information is fed into the algorithms, the more accurate they become.
          The past few decades have seen massive scalability of data and
          information, allowing for much more accurate predictions than were
          ever possible in the long history of machine learning.
        </li>

        <li>
          New techniques in the field – that mostly involve combining pieces
          that already existed in the past – have enabled an extraordinary
          research effort in Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This has not been the
          result of a major breakthrough, but rather of much faster computers
          and thousands of researchers contributing incremental improvements.
          This has enabled researchers to expand what’s possible, to the point
          that machines are outperforming humans for difficult but narrowly
          defined tasks such as recognizing faces or playing the game of Go.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Importance Of Machine Learning</h3>

      <p>
        Machine learning has several very practical applications that drive the
        kind of real business results – such as time and money savings – that
        have the potential to dramatically impact the future of your
        organization. At Interactions in particular, we see tremendous impact
        occurring within the customer care industry, whereby machine learning is
        allowing people to get things done more quickly and efficiently. Through
        Virtual Assistant solutions, machine learning automates tasks that would
        otherwise need to be performed by a live agent – such as changing a
        password or checking an account balance. This frees up valuable agent
        time that can be used to focus on the kind of customer care that humans
        perform best: high touch, complicated decision-making that is not as
        easily handled by a machine. At Interactions, we further improve the
        process by eliminating the decision of whether a request should be sent
        to a human or a machine: unique Adaptive Understanding Technology, the
        machine learns to be aware of its limitations, and bail out to humans
        when it has a low confidence in providing the correct solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Machine learning has made dramatic improvements in the past few years,
        but we are still very far from reaching human performance. Many times,
        the machine needs the assistance of human to complete its task. At
        Interactions, we have deployed Virtual Assistant solutions that
        seamlessly blend artificial with true human intelligence to deliver the
        highest level of accuracy and understanding.
      </p>

      <h3>
        To conclude, machine learning is the future that is knocking on our
        doors with increasing urgency. The question is, are we ready to open the
        door and welcome it into our lives?
