        The concept of ‘connectivity’ is going beyond laptops and smartphones as
        we see it moving towards smart cities, smart homes, smart retail, smart
        farming, connected cars, connected wearable devices and connected
        healthcare. In short a connected life. The Internet of Things is a
        popular terminology these days, but unlike many technological fads which
        have come and gone in the last years, the Internet of Things proves to
        be an important trend which is having long lasting effects on the
        society. The term “Internet of Things” itself is used to mean a variety
        of ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        IoT or internet of thing these days we quite often listen to this word.
        The words such as the cyber-attack, hacking we can hear these too
        jointly with IoT. Despite, of the fear of piracy and cyberattack the
        internet of things and IoT applications will grow much more faster in
        the coming years. Ultimately we can say the IoT future scope or the
        future of IoT is very bright. There will a lot of IoT devices which will
        be coming shortly.
      </p>

      <p>
        If businesses want to regulate themselves before the government does,
        they will have to take steps to ensure the data that feeds their AI is
        fair and unbiased, and that their models are empathetic, transparent,
        and robust. Organizations will also need to implement a way to closely
        monitor their AI — with a robust simulation capability and automated
        oversight –, so it doesn’t go off the rails as it “learns.” So far,
        businesses have come up short, and unless they make meaningful strides,
        government regulators will crank up the heat this year.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we all know, a connection precipitates another connection. Earlier in
        the 19th century, only 4% of the people present worldwide knew about the
        Internet, that is when the Internet of Things concept came to light.
        But, realize it became like no one in the earth doesn’t know about the
        Internet of Things. Experts predicts that Indian IoT market will grow
        from $1.5 billion today to more than $9 billion by 2020 with over 2.7
        billion connected devices and growing. Another Gartner report predicts,
        by ‘2020 the number of connected devices across all technologies will
        reach to about 20.6 billion’.
      </p>

      <h3>The Real World IoT-Cloud Platform Application:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Smart Home Automation: How would you feel if you could switch off
          lights after you left home/office or switch the AC on before reaching
          home? With IoT taking shape there is introduction of a world where all
          the smart devices can be in constant connection with each other and
          are monitored by users remotely via voice commands or by a simple
          click. With the rapid growth of IoT it is predicted Smart Homes will
          be as common as smart phones. It has also been predicted by Gil Press
          that more than two thirds of consumers plan to buy connected
          technology for their homes by 2019.
        </li>

        <li>
          Smart Wearable Technology: A detailed report by TechRepublic says in
          2016, wearables were sold at a rate of 38 million and a large portion
          of them were fitness trackers and smart watches. These two
          classifications will make up a joint income of $4.9 billion. Wearable
          devices are installed with sensors and softwares which collect data
          and information about the users. This data is later pre-processed to
          extract essential insights about the user. The pre-requisite from Iot
          Technology for wearable applications is to be highly energy efficient,
          low power and small sized. The productivity of data processing
          achieved by various smart wrist wear, hearable, and smart glasses is
          getting closer to where wearables will bring exceptional value to our
          lives.
        </li>

        <li>
          Connected Vehicles: Gartner predicts that about 250,000,000 connected
          cars will be out on the roads by 2020. So, what really are connected
          cars? IoT engineers have come up with an industry solution for
          connected automobiles that gathers, analyzes, stores and takes action
          on vehicle sensor data. A connected vehicle is one which is able to
          improve and analyze its own operation, maintenance as well as comfort
          of passengers using onboard sensors and internet connectivity. IoT for
          automobiles is a vehicle-to-cloud offering that enables awareness of
          the environment even beyond the vehicles and helps use information to
          establish a relationship with the driver as well.
        </li>

        <li>
          Industrial Internet: The IIoT (Industrial IoT) enables industrial
          engineering with sensors, software and big data analytics to build
          intelligent equipment. Smart machines are precise and consistent than
          humans in communicating data. And this analytics on the generated data
          can help companies pick inabilities and problems fast. In the
          meanwhile, did you know that about 5.4 million IoT devices will be
          used on oil extraction sites by 2020 to provide environmental metrics
          about extraction sites?
        </li>

        <li>
          Smart Cities: IoT has the potential of solving major problems faced by
          the people living in cities like pollution, traffic congestion and
          shortage of energy supplies etc. IoT will empower cities to leverage
          their network to offer advanced smart city applications for citizens,
          new eco-sustainability initiatives and create first-hand opportunities
          for enterprise development.
        </li>

        <li>
          IoT in Agriculture: To help increase farm performance, IoT technology
          providers continue to develop IoT cloud based platforms that can
          sense, process and communicate precisely measured environmental data.
          Farms are becoming more connected as farmers realize the potential of
          IoT in helping them reduce cost while achieving improved results.
        </li>

        <li>
          Smart Retail: IoT Smart Retail enables stores to revolutionize
          customer service while saving time and money, while simultaneously
          providing the consumer with a seamless shopping experience. By
          installing this system, retailers are also able to recapture
          investment dollars while surpassing expectations for tech-savvy
          consumers. Some of the components included in Smart Retail are Power
          shelf, Beacons and Digital Price Tags.
        </li>

        <li>
          IoT for Healthcare: Research says IoT in healthcare will be enormous
          in coming years. It aims at enabling people to live healthier life by
          wearing connected devices. For example, through IoT, doctors can use
          GPS services and be prepared for treating patients being brought to
          the hospital in emergency cases.
        </li>

        <li>
          IoT in Telecom Industry: Global telecom operators now use IoT enabled
          digital platforms that are a combination of connectivity, analysis,
          security, mobile and cloud to support businesses. This is helping them
          reduce operating costs while enabling end-users to consume technology
          in a business focused manner saving time and money.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How Many IoT Devices Will There Be In 2025?</h3>

      <p>
        We can say one thing for sure the number of IoT or the Internet of
        Things devices will outnumber the total population of the earth. While
        we can even say that the Internet of Things or future of IoT is
        something which is increasing tremendously in an unexpected way.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion-</h3>

      <p>
        While we come to an end, the IoT or the Internet of Things has made the
        lives of the human being straightforward and comfortable. It has made
        the lives of the people very convenient. Whereas on the other hand with
        the increased use of the Internet of Things the treat for security and
        safety has also increase. So we should be careful while providing the
        details on the Internet platform. Hence, this was a brief overview of
        future of IoT, offers to the employee in the future and what makes it an
        amazing technology. Furthermore, if you have any query regarding IoT or
        any other Technology feel free to ask in the comment section. For more
